## Description of the problems

###### [Ilya and Queries](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/313/B?locale=en)

This solution uses a support array b[], in order to keep track of the sum of the elements that are equal to their successor.
In this way it is implemented the **static prefix sum**, so the answer to the queries just takes constant time.

**Time complexity:** θ(n+q).
**Space complexity:** O(n).
